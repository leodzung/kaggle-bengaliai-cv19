## How to run

Please make sure you run each of the scripts in `./src` directory.

### Preparation

#### download competition dataset

Download [competition datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19/data) in `./input/bengaliai-cv19/` directory and unzip there. You can do this easily using [kaggle api](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api). The example below is done in `./src` directory.

~~~
$ kaggle c download bengaliai-cv19 -p ../input/bengaliai-cv19/
$ unzip ../input/bengaliai-cv19/bengaliai-cv19.zip -d ../input/bengaliai-cv19/
~~~

#### download pre-trained models
Next, you have to download [chainercv pre-trained SE-ResNeXt models on ImageNet](https://www.kaggle.com/ttahara/chainercv-seresnext) in `./input/chainercv-seresnext` directory and unzip there. You can do this by one line using kaggle api.

~~~
$ kaggle d download ttahara/chainercv-seresnext -p ../input/chainercv-seresnext/ --unzip
~~~

#### pre-process competition data

In `./src` directory, run this.

~~~
$ python preprocess.py -tr -te
~~~

[preprocess.py](./src/preprocess.py) does the following at once.
  
- creates new directories for `.png` images : `./processed_data/train` and `./processed_data/test`
- convert `.parquet` files into `.png` images and save them in those directories.
- apply mult-label stratified group k-fold(k=4) to `train.csv` and save it as `./processed_data/train_add-4fold-index.csv` (but actually not used)
- reshape `test.csv` to the same format as `train.csv` and save it as `./processed_data/test_reshaped.csv`


### Training

In `./src` directory, run this.

~~~
$ python nn_train.py -s settings_final_model.yml -o ../output/00_SERX50sSE_128x224_3x35epoch_all_data
~~~

- `-s` : specifies a training settings file written by `YAML` format
- `-o` : specifies a directory to output training results(trained weights, log, copy of settings file, and so on).
    - The specified directory is newly created (if the same name directory exists, this program will quit).

### Infernce 

#### inference by single model.

In `./src` directory, run this. (The example below uses the model of 70 epoch.)

~~~
$ python nn_inference.py -t ../output/00_SERX50sSE_128x224_3x35epoch_all_data -o ../output/00_infer_by_epoch70 -e 70 -g 0 -bs 128
~~~

- `-t` : specifies a directory to output training results which includes trained weights for inference.
- `-o` : specifies a directory to output inference outputs
    - logits for each class : numpy.ndarray saved as `.npz` file
    - prediction for each example by submission format: pandas.Dataframe saved as `.csv` file
    - The specified directory is newly created (if the same name directory exists, this program will quit).
- `-e` : specifies the epoch of model weights for inference
    - if corresponding file does not exist, use the model of last epoch
- `-g` : specifies a gpu device for inference.



### inference by snapshot ensemble

In `./src` directory, run this.

~~~
$ python nn_inference_by_snapshot_ensemble.py -t ../output/00_SERX50sSE_128x224_3x35epoch_all_data -o ../output/00_infer_by_snapshot_ensemble -bs 128 -g 0
~~~

- `-t` : specifies a directory to output training results which includes trained weights for inference.
- `-o` : specifies a directory to output inference outputs
    - logits for each class : numpy.ndarray saved as `.npz` file
    - prediction for each example by submission format: pandas.Dataframe saved as `.csv` file
    - The specified directory is newly created (if the same name directory exists, this program will quit).
    - if corresponding file does not exist, use the model of last epoch
- `-g` : specifies a gpu device for inference.
